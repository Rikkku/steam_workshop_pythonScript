# steam_workshop_pythonScript

This Python script allows you to download workshop content using the Steam Web API key.

## Usage

- Clone the repository or download the `download.py` and `config.json` file.

- Replace the API key and the workshop ID in the `config.json` file. Ensure that you provide the workshop ID as the last digits of the workshop file, not the entire URL.

- Run the Python script:

  ```shell
  python download.py

Note
The script has been tested with CSGO workshops. It may not work with other workshops like Wallpaper Engine.

For assistance with downloading Wallpaper Engine workshops or if you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out via direct message.

Please make sure to replace the placeholders (API key and workshop ID) with the actual values in your config.json file.
